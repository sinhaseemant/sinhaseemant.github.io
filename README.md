# My resume

_This project is my resume as a Single Page website._

<div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://sinhaseemant.github.io">
            <img src="./public/preview.png" alt="Preview" style="max-height:250px"/>
        </a>
    </p>
</div>

## Global information

You can use a distant database to complete your resume with a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) query or set your resume in a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) class. 
The class will be used in case of failure while reaching the database. The internalization is configured with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/).
